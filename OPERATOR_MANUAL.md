## üéØ System Overview

ResolveLight is an automated invoice processing system that validates, matches, and routes invoices for payment. The system uses artificial intelligence to:

- **Match invoices** to purchase orders and contracts
- **Validate** invoice details against business rules
- **Detect duplicates** and prevent overpayments
- **Route exceptions** to appropriate queues for human review
- **Approve valid invoices** for automatic payment

### What This Means for You

As an operator, you'll primarily work with:
- **Approved invoices** that process automatically
- **Exception queues** that need your review and action
- **System logs** for monitoring and troubleshooting

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Starting the System

1. **Open Terminal** in Cursor
2. **Activate Virtual Environment** (use your keyboard shortcut: `Option + Command + V`)
3. **Run the System**:
   ```bash
   python runner.py
   ```

### Your First Invoice

When you start the system, you'll see:
```
Running agent SourceToPay, type exit to exit.
[user]: 
```

To process an invoice, simply provide the file path:
```
[user]: /path/to/invoice_file.json
```

The system will automatically:
1. Find the matching purchase order and contract
2. Validate the invoice details
3. Make a routing decision
4. Show you the result

## üìä Daily Operations

### Processing Invoices

#### Step 1: Submit Invoice
Provide the full path to your invoice JSON file:
```
[user]: json_files/golden_invoices/invoice_Aegis_PO-2025-304A.json
```

#### Step 2: Review Results
The system will show you a detailed report:

**‚úÖ APPROVED Invoices:**
```
[contract_matching_agent]: Invoice: invoice_id: INV-AEG-2025-001, purchase_order_number: PO-2025-304A
PO Item: po_number: PO-2025-304A, contract_id: CON-TECH-2025-004
Contract: contract_id: CON-TECH-2025-004, contract_title: 2025 Master Services Agreement - Project Aegis

[validation_agent]: supplier_match_tool: PASS
simple_overbilling_tool: PASS
date_check_tool: PASS
validation: PASS

[triage_agent]: APPROVED
```

**‚ùå REJECTED Invoices:**
```
[contract_matching_agent]: Invoice: invoice_id: INV-NEX-2025-001, purchase_order_number: <not found>
PO Item: po_number: <not found>, contract_id: <not found>
Contract: contract_id: <not found>, contract_title: <not found>

[validation_agent]: dependency_check: FAIL - reasons: po_item_not_found, contract_not_found
validation: FAIL

[triage_agent]: REJECTED - reasons: po_item_not_found, contract_not_found
```

### Understanding the Results

#### ‚úÖ APPROVED
- Invoice is valid and ready for payment
- All validations passed
- No human intervention needed
- Payment will be processed automatically

#### ‚ùå REJECTED
- Invoice has issues that prevent automatic payment
- Check the specific failure reasons
- Invoice will be routed to an exception queue for review

## üîç Understanding Invoice Processing

### The Three-Step Process

#### 1. Contract Matching
**What it does:** Finds the purchase order and contract for the invoice
**What you see:**
- Invoice details (ID, PO number)
- Matched PO information
- Contract details

**Common issues:**
- `<not found>` means the PO or contract doesn't exist
- Check if invoice has correct PO number
- Verify PO and contract files are in the system

#### 2. Validation
**What it does:** Checks invoice against business rules
**Validation checks:**
- **Supplier Match:** Is the supplier correct?
- **Overbilling:** Is the amount within limits?
- **Date Check:** Are dates valid?
- **Line Items:** Do line items match the PO?

**What you see:**
- Each validation tool result (PASS/FAIL)
- Overall validation status

#### 3. Triage Resolution
**What it does:** Makes final routing decision
**Possible outcomes:**
- **APPROVED:** Ready for payment
- **REJECTED:** Sent to exception queue
- **PENDING_APPROVAL:** Needs manager approval

## üö® Exception Queues and Resolution

When invoices are rejected, they're sent to specialized queues based on the type of problem.

### High Priority Queues (Manager Approval Required)

#### üî¥ Duplicate Invoices
**What it is:** Potential duplicate payments detected
**What to do:**
1. Check the duplicate detection log
2. Compare with previously processed invoices
3. If truly duplicate, reject permanently
4. If not duplicate, investigate matching logic

#### üî¥ Missing Data
**What it is:** Missing purchase order or contract data
**What to do:**
1. Verify PO number is correct
2. Check if PO file exists in the system
3. Create missing PO or contract if needed
4. Re-process the invoice

#### üî¥ Low Confidence Matches
**What it is:** Fuzzy matching below 70% confidence
**What to do:**
1. Review the matching analysis
2. Check for typos in PO numbers or supplier names
3. Manually verify the match
4. Update data if needed and re-process

#### üî¥ Price Discrepancies
**What it is:** Line item validation failures
**What to do:**
1. Compare invoice line items with PO line items
2. Check for quantity or price differences
3. Verify if changes are legitimate
4. Approve if valid, reject if not

#### üî¥ Billing Discrepancies
**What it is:** Overbilling or arithmetic errors
**What to do:**
1. Check total amounts against PO limits
2. Verify calculations are correct
3. Check for unauthorized charges
4. Approve if within limits, reject if overbilling

#### üî¥ High Value Approval
**What it is:** Invoices over $10,000
**What to do:**
1. Review all details carefully
2. Verify against contract terms
3. Check for proper authorization
4. Approve if all checks pass

### Medium Priority Queues (No Manager Approval Required)

#### üü° Supplier Mismatch
**What it is:** Supplier information doesn't match
**What to do:**
1. Check supplier name and vendor ID
2. Verify against PO and contract
3. Update supplier information if needed
4. Re-process the invoice

#### üü° Date Discrepancies
**What it is:** Date validation failures
**What to do:**
1. Check invoice date, due date, and payment terms
2. Verify against contract terms
3. Check for reasonable date ranges
4. Approve if dates are valid

### Normal Priority Queues

#### üü¢ General Exceptions
**What it is:** Other validation failures
**What to do:**
1. Review the specific error message
2. Check all invoice details
3. Verify against business rules
4. Take appropriate action
