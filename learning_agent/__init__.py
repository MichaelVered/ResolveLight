Learning Agent Package
Provides intelligent analysis and optimization planning for the ResolveLight system.

Note: Avoid importing heavy modules at package import time to prevent
environment-dependent side effects (e.g., optional LLM SDKs).
Import submodules directly where needed instead of from package root.
